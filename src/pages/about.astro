          <p class="mb-6">
            Founded in 2010, Discount Landscaper LV began with a simple mission: to provide Las Vegas homeowners with high-quality landscaping services at affordable prices. What started as a small operation has grown into one of the most trusted landscaping companies in the Las Vegas Valley.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Our founder, Michael Rodriguez, recognized the unique challenges of desert landscaping and the importance of water conservation in our community. He built a team of skilled professionals who share his passion for creating beautiful, sustainable outdoor spaces that thrive in the Las Vegas climate.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Over the years, we've expanded our services to include artificial turf installation, paver patios, hardscaping, and complete landscape renovations. Throughout our growth, we've maintained our commitment to quality craftsmanship, customer satisfaction, and environmental responsibility.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Today, we're proud to have transformed thousands of properties across Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas. Our team continues to grow, but our dedication to exceptional service remains unchanged.
